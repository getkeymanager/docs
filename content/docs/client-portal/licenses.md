The My Licenses page is your personal repository for all software entitlements purchased or assigned to your account. It allows you to track the lifecycle of your licenses from initial assignment to expiration.

---

## What Is This Page?

This page provides a searchable, filterable list of every license you own. It is the primary location for retrieving license keys and checking the health and validity of your software installations.

---

## Key Features

### 1. License Inventory
The main list provides high-level visibility into:
- **License Status**: Clearly labeled badges (e.g., `Active`, `Expired`, `Revoked`, `Suspended`).
- **Activation Progress**: Track how many devices you have registered versus your total limit (e.g., `2 / 5`).
- **Expiration Tracking**: Automatic warnings for licenses expiring within 7 days.

### 2. Comprehensive Details
Clicking **View Details** on any license provides a deep dive into its configuration:
- **Secure Key Retrieval**: Your full license key is available with a one-click "Copy to Clipboard" utility.
- **Validation Diagnostics**: If a license is not working as expected, the "Validation Status" section provides a detailed explanation (e.g., "Activation limit reached" or "License expired").
- **Product Context**: View the specific product name, version eligibility, and environment (Production/Staging).

### 3. Advanced Filtering
Easily locate specific keys or products using:
- **Global Search**: Search by full or partial license keys and product names.
- **Status Filtering**: Isolate specific licenses by their current state (e.g., show only `Suspended` licenses).

## Understanding License States

| State | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Active** | Valid and currently in use on one or more devices. |
| **Assigned** | Assigned to you but not yet activated on any device. |
| **Suspended** | Temporarily disabled by the administrator. |
| **Expired** | The subscription period has ended. |
| **Revoked** | Permanently disabled and cannot be used again. |

## How to Access

1. Log in to the **Customer Portal**.
2. Click **My Licenses** in the sidebar navigation.

## Troubleshooting

- **License Key Not Showing**: Some high-security keys may remain masked until you click the "Copy" icon. If the key is entirely missing, contact your administrator.
- **Activation Limit Error**: If you see a "Limit Reached" error in the Validation Status, navigate to the [Activations]({{< ref "/docs/content/docs/client-portal/activations" >}}) page to deactivate an old device.
- **Red Expiry Date**: This indicates the license has already expired and the software will no longer authenticate. You must renew your license to restore functionality.
