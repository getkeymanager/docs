## Key Features

### 1. Performance Metrics (KPIs)
Four key metrics help you monitor your account health:
- **Total Licenses**: The total number of licenses assigned to your account.
- **Active Licenses**: Licenses that are currently valid and not expired or suspended.
- **Activations in Use**: The total count of devices or domains currently authenticated across all your licenses.
- **Expiring Soon**: A count of licenses set to expire within the next 30 days, requiring renewal attention.

### 2. Quick Actions
One-click access to core portal functions:
- **View All Licenses**: Navigate to your full license library.
- **Manage Activations**: Jump directly to device deactivation tools.
- **Downloads**: Access software installers and updates.

### 3. Recent Licenses
A summary table of your 5 most recently acquired licenses, showing:
- **License Key**: Masked for security.
- **Product Name**: The software associated with the license.
- **Status**: The current state (e.g., Active, Expired).
- **Added Date**: When the license was assigned to you.

## Troubleshooting

- **KPIs Not Updating**: Dashboard data is refreshed on every page load. If you recently purchased a license and it isn't appearing, ensure the transaction has completed and refresh the page.
- **Missing Licenses**: Ensure you are logged in with the email address associated with your purchase.
- **Expiring Soon Warning**: If paths show "Expiring Soon," click the license key in the [My Licenses]({{< ref "/docs/client-portal/licenses" >}}) section to view renewal options or contact support.
