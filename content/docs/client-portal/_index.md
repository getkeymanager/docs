## Purpose
The Client Portal is a secure interface for end customers who own licenses. It provides transparency, allows customers to manage activations, access downloads, and reduces support dependency.

## Who Can Access
- Customers who own licenses
- Users invited or provisioned by the system
- Authenticated via customer-specific authentication

Client Portal users are isolated from admins, other customers, and internal system configuration.

## Authentication & Security
- Email-based authentication
- Password or secure login link
- Session-based authentication
- No API key access
- No admin permissions
- UUID-based routing
- Strict session isolation
