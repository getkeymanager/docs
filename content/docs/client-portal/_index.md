# Customer Self-Service Portal

The **Customer Self-Service Portal** is a secure, first-class architectural surface designed to empower license owners. It provides full transparency into license ownership and allows for autonomous management of software installations and assets.

---

## Overview

Instead of relying on manual support requests, customers can use this portal to manage their entire relationship with the platform. It is strictly separated from the Admin Portal to ensure security and prevent unauthorized access to multi-customer telemetry or management tools.

### Who Is This For?

- **Direct Customers**: Individuals or organizations who have purchased licenses.
- **End Users**: Users who have been assigned licenses by an administrator.

### Key Capabilities

- **License Transparency**: View live status, keys, and feature entitlements.
- **Self-Service HWID Management**: Remotely deactivate hardware and domain bindings to free up license slots.
- **Secure Asset Delivery**: Access product installers and documentation via crytographically signed download links.
- **Account Governance**: Manage personal profile data, credentials, and notification preferences.
