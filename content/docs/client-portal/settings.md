The Account Settings page allows you to personalize your experience within the Customer Portal and control how the platform communicates with you.

## What Is This Page?

This page manages your regional preferences and notification triggers. These settings ensure that the timestamps you see are relevant to your location and that you only receive the alerts you care about.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Regional Preferences
- **Timezone Selection**: Choose your local timezone from a comprehensive global list. This setting updates all timestamps across the dashboard, licenses, and activation lists to match your local time.

### 2. Communication Preferences
Control the volume and type of emails you receive from the platform:
- **Email Notifications**: Toggle general notifications about your licenses and activation status.
- **Security Alerts**: Enable or disable alerts regarding important security events, such as login attempts from new devices or password changes.
*Crucial security alerts may still be sent regardless of this setting if they are classified as mandatory by the system administrator.*

### 3. Interface Customization
- **Theme Toggle**: While managed via the top navigation bar, the settings page confirms your ability to switch between **Light** and **Dark** modes for optimal viewing comfort.

## How to Access

1. Log in to the **Customer Portal**.
2. Click **Settings** in the sidebar navigation.

## Troubleshooting

- **Timestamps Still Incorrect**: Double-check that you have clicked **Save Settings** after selecting your new timezone. The change is not applied until the form is submitted.
- **Not Receiving Emails**: 
    - Ensure **Email Notifications** is toggled ON.
    - Check your spam folder for messages from the platform's domain.
    - Verify your account email address on the [Profile](profile) page.
- **Settings Not Saving**: If you encounter an error while saving, ensure your internet connection is stable and refresh the page before trying again.
