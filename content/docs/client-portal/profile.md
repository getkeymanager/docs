## What Is This Page?

This page centralizes your account identity. It is divided into two primary sections: General Profile Information and Password Management.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Profile Information
Keep your account details up to date:
- **Display Name**: Update how your name appears across the portal and in automated communications.
- **Immutable Email**: For security and licensing integrity, your primary email address is **read-only**. This ensures that license ownership remains tied to the verified purchasing account.
*Note: To change your email address, please contact support.*

### 2. Password Management
Maintain account security with self-service password updates:
- **Verification**: You must provide your **current password** to authorize a change.
- **Strength Requirements**: New passwords must be at least **8 characters** long. For maximum security, we recommend a mix of uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Confirmation**: A second password entry ensures no typos occur during the update process.

### 3. Account History
- **Membership Status**: Review exactly when your account was created.
- **Help Integration**: Quick links to the support desk are available if you encounter issues with your credentials.

## How to Access

1. Log in to the **Customer Portal**.
2. Click **Profile** in the sidebar navigation or select it from the user dropdown in the top header.

## Troubleshooting

- **Incorrect Password Error**: If you cannot remember your current password to change it to a new one, use the "Forgot Password" link on the login page to perform a full reset via email.
- **Update Failed**: Ensure all required fields (marked with a red asterisk `*`) are completed before saving.
- **Name Not Updating**: The name field has a 255-character limit. Ensure your entry is within this range.
