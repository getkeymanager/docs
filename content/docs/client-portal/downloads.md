## What Is This Page?

This page is dynamically generated based on your active licenses. It ensures you always have access to the latest versions and assets you are entitled to, while maintaining high security through signed delivery links.

---

## Key Features

### 1. Entitlement-Based Access
What you see on this page is directly tied to your ownership:
- **Product Grouping**: Files are neatly organized by product (e.g., "Standard SDK", "Enterprise Plugin").
- **Version Filtering**: Access previous versions or the latest release depending on your license's maintenance terms.
- **Access Verification**: The system automatically hides downloads if your license is expired, suspended, or revoked.

### 2. High-Density Asset Information
Each downloadable item provides critical metadata:
- **Release Version**: Clearly marked version numbers (e.g., `v2.4.0`).
- **File Metadata**: View file sizes (e.g., `12.50 MB`) and release dates to ensure you are downloading the correct patch.
- **Classification**: Visual tags distinguish between `Stable`, `Beta`, or `Hotfix` releases.

### 3. Secure Delivery
To protect intellectual property and ensure link integrity:
- **Signed URLs**: When you click "Download," the system generates a crytographically signed link unique to your session.
- **Expiration Policy**: These links are valid for **15 minutes**. If the download doesn't start or is interrupted after this window, you must refresh the page and generate a new link.

## How to Access

1. Log in to the **Customer Portal**.
2. Click **Downloads** in the sidebar navigation.

## Troubleshooting

- **"No Downloads Available"**: 
    - Verify that you have a license in an `Active` or `Assigned` state.
    - Check the [My Licenses](licenses) page to ensure your support/update period has not expired.
- **Link Expired Error**: If you wait too long after clicking the download button, the S3 signed URL will expire. Simply refresh the page and click "Download" again.
- **Access Denied**: If you believe you should have access to a file but are seeing an error, ensure your license covers that specific product version. Maintenance renewals may be required for major version jumps.
